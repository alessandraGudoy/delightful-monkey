In other words, the sum of b and c have a pair of factors a and (s + t). Therefore, a divides the sum, (b + c), => a|(b + c).\n",

    "a. Following pseudocode on slide #30, implement a function to perform binary addition. The function takes two integers as inputs, and returns the binary representation of the sum of the two numbers as a string. Note that the addition has to be performed using the binary representations of the two integers, meaning you can not do '5+8 = 13' then return the binary representation of 13. Use the following pairs to test your code: $(24,98), (2387482,1), (25,25)$\n",
